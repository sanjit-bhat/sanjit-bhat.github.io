    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
        My name is Sanjit Bhat and I'm a junior in Acton-Boxborough Regional High School. When I'm not in
        school, I usually spend most of my time doing research in the <a href="http://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/index.php">MIT PRIMES</a> program.
    </p>

    <p>
        My current research is in adversarial machine learning. I'm working with Dimitris Tsipras in the <a
            href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/madry/lab">Madry Lab</a>,
        creating experiments which take a principled approach toward deep learning. My current overarching goals are to
        understand why and when neural networks work, in what situations they can be broken,
        and how to design more robust networks.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the past, I worked with <a href="http://albertkwon.com">Albert Kwon</a> and David Lu on a Computer Security
        project. Together, we studied anonymous networks such as Tor and created better attacks and defenses for
        Website Fingerprinting. My work was mainly focused on the attack, which used some interesting techniques to
        deal with packet sequence classification on a small data set (more details can be found in the paper).
