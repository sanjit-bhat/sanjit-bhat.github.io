I'm a second-year [Turing Scholar](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/turing-scholars)
Honors Computer Science student
at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/),
broadly interested in the intersection of systems and security.
At UT, I work with [Hovav Shacham](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~hovav/)
on browser fingerprinting.
What excites me is the application of technology for social good,
and I'm constantly thinking about how this can be achieved.

In high school, I spent three years in the 
[MIT PRIMES](http://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/index.php) program,
a year-long independent research program for high school students.
During my first half of PRIMES, I worked with [David Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SIIZ_bAAAAAJ&hl=en)
under the mentorship of [Albert Kwon](https://albertkwon.com/) and [Srini Devadas](https://people.csail.mit.edu/devadas/).
We studied anonymous communication networks and created state-of-the-art 
website fingerprinting attacks and defenses against such networks.
During my second half,
I worked under the mentorship of [Dimitris Tsipras](http://people.csail.mit.edu/tsipras/)
and [Aleksander Mądry](https://people.csail.mit.edu/madry/)
in the [Mądry Lab](http://people.csail.mit.edu/madry/lab).
We conducted research to improve the efficiency of adversarial machine learning, which is
a technique used to harden deep neural networks against adversarial attacks.
