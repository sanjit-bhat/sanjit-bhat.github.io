I'm a senior at Acton-Boxborough Regional High School and a third-year
student in the [MIT PRIMES](http://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/index.php) program,
a year-long independent research program for high school students.

During my first year and part of my second year, I worked with
David Lu under the mentorship of [Albert Kwon](http://albertkwon.com) on a Computer
Security project. Together, we studied anonymous networks and created better Website Fingerprinting attacks and
defenses. I worked mainly on the attack, applying novel techniques from deep learning
to solve a network packet sequence classification problem.

I'm currently working under the mentorship of [Dimitris Tsipras](http://people.csail.mit.edu/tsipras/)
in the [MÄ…dry Lab](http://people.csail.mit.edu/madry/lab) at MIT,
conducting research in a subfield of theoretical machine learning called adversarial ML.
My overarching goals are to understand the fundamentals of why and when neural networks work and back
this understanding up with theory and rigorous experiments.
